# Using Machine Learning to Predict Person Demographics from Images

A series of documents that detail steps we took to predict demographics of people from images using Machine Learning.

These projects use Python 3 and TendorFlow 2.x, and are created in Jupyter Notebooks for your convenience. Our models were created using a NVIDIA GTX 1080 on a Windows 10 platform.

All Python package requirements used can be installed y running the following command in the directory where you checked out this project:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
